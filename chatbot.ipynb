      "\n",
      "Thanks — happy to move this. Based on Dallas → Los Angeles, ~1,450 miles, electronics, 30,000 lbs (assume standard palletized dry-van, dock-to-dock, single stop):\n",
      "\n",
      "My all-in asking rate: $3,150 ($2.17/mile; ≈ $0.105/lb).  \n",
      "If you can confirm and book today I can drop to $2,950. My bottom acceptable: $2,700.\n",
      "\n",
      "What this assumes\n",
      "- Standard dock-to-dock pickup & delivery, single stop\n",
      "- Palletized, shrink-wrapped, no special equipment or hazmat\n",
      "- No detention, lumper, liftgate, inside delivery, or extra stops\n",
      "- Normal insurance/declared value for electronics (if higher declared value required, rate adjusts)\n",
      "\n",
      "If any of the above apply (liftgate, residential/inside delivery, appointments, extra stops, limited access, driver waiting/detention, or higher declared value) I’ll need to add standard accessorials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transit time estimate: approximately 3–4 days door-to-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Questions before we finalize\n",
      "- Pickup and delivery dates/windows?\n",
      "- Pallet count and dimensions (if available)?\n",
      "- Any required appointments, liftgate, inside delivery or residential stops?\n",
      "- Declared value / special insurance needed?\n",
      "- Payment terms (Net 15/Net 30)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Respond with the details and we’ll lock it in — we can move quickly at $2,950 if you can confirm today.\n",
      "================================\u001b[1m Human Message \u001b[0m=================================\n",
      "\n",
      "But I know someone who could do it for 2500 can you lower your price?\n",
      "==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m==================================\n",
      "\n",
      "I get it — price matters. I can’t match $2,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "This load is electronics, long-haul, and requires reliable equipment, experienced drivers, higher declared-value coverage and clean on-time pickup/delivery to avoid damage/chargebacks. A $2,500 rate would force corners I’m not willing to take on high-value freight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are two workable options:\n",
      "- Priority/guaranteed: $2,950 — same offer as before if you can confirm today; priority dispatch, real-time tracking, and tight ETA adherence.  \n",
      "- Firm bottom: $2,700 — my absolute minimum if you need the move but can confirm now and accept standard dock-to-dock, single stop, no extra accessorials.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the $2,500 quote includes any of the following (lower declared value, no tracking, long driver wait, or restricted pickup/delivery windows), it’s not equivalent. Tell me the pickup/delivery dates and any special requirements and we’ll lock one of the two rates.\n",

      "I can’t drop to $2,500 — that rate would force corners on a long haul high‑value electronics move. My firm, non‑negotiable bottom is $2,700 (dock‑to‑dock, single stop, standard declared value, no detention/lumper/liftgate). \n",
      "\n",
      "Two quick options:\n",
      "- Priority same‑day dispatch: $2,950 (best service, tight ETA/tracking).  \n",
      "- Firm, reliable move: $2,700 if you confirm now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll consider $2,650 only if you (a) confirm within 2 hours, (b) accept Net‑7 payment, and (c) there are no extra accessorials or appointment windows. \n",

      "If you want me to lock one, send pickup/delivery dates, pallet count/dimensions, and payment terms.\n",

      "- Firm, reliable: $2,700 — my absolute minimum for dock‑to‑dock, single stop, standard declared value, no accessorials.  \n",
      "- Short‑term concession: $2,650 if you confirm within 2 hours, accept Net‑7 payment, and there are no extra accessorials or appointment windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I’m assuming\n",
      "- Standard palletized dry‑van, dock‑to‑dock, single stop\n",
      "- No liftgate/inside delivery/residential stop\n",
      "- No detention/lumper/extra stops\n",
      "- Normal insurance/declared value (if you need higher declared value coverage, rate will increase)\n",

      "\n",
      "- Premium (priority dispatch, tight ETA/tracking): $2,950.  \n",
      "- Standard (reliable dock‑to‑dock, single stop): $2,700 — my firm minimum.  \n",
      "- Time‑sensitive concession: $2,600 if you confirm within 90 minutes, accept Net‑7 payment, and there are no accessorials or appointment windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why I can’t take $2,500: long distance, high‑value electronics require experienced drivers, higher insurance/declared value handling, and low risk of damage/chargebacks — those add real cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want me to lock equipment, send:\n",
      "- Pickup date/time window and delivery window\n",
      "- Pallet count and dimensions\n",
